    Challenge

    #details
    The goal of the game is to challenge the player while depolluting and reforesting planets as one travel across galaxies contaminated by decades of space exploration. EcoRescue was conceptualized and designed by Naima Gradi (PhD fellow), Swann Pichon (HES-SO) and Daphne Bavelier (UNIGE). It was programmed by the FCBG VR & Digital Engineering platform vr.fcbg.ch. EcoRescue was funded by a Swiss National Science Foundation grant (10001C_212812 To SP) and by a European Research Council Synergy grant (the self-teaching brain, 810580 To DB).
