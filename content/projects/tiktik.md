    Challenge

    #details
    I worked as the project manager for this Unity project. It was a rewarding yet challenging experience, and we experimented with a few collaborative methods that were successfull, including the use of notion and some git and dev practices. With a team of three, our efforts were distributed effectively: one colleague focused on design and UI effects, bringing visual elements to life with stunning effects; another dedicated their time to crafting a particle system for the beams and an intricate replay system that added a visual feedback for the researcher. 
    
    My responsibilities included implementing player interaction mechanics, laying the groundwork for seamless level play, and developing tools for efficient level creation. 
    Additionally, I tackled the complexities of local multiplayer functionality (and currently working on online multiplayer), ensuring smooth controller support. Managing the data and player account system, along with a log-in and level progression, added another layer of complexity, requiring meticulous attention to detail to maintain security and user experience.
