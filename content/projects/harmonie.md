    "HarMoNie" is an innovative, multilingual educational application built with Flutter, commissioned by the Haute École de Musique (HEM). The platform's core mission is to provide musicians with comprehensive, structured lessons and interactive exercises focused on crucial health-related topics, fostering a proactive approach to their well-being.

    Key technical challenges involved architecting a robust system for managing and localizing diverse educational content—including Markdown, images, and videos—across multiple languages. This included implementing a prerequisite system for lessons to ensure a cohesive learning path, and developing engaging game-like features such as "spot the 7 errors" and quizzes (QCMs) to enhance user interaction and knowledge retention. The application also supports seamless visualization of photos and videos to enrich the educational experience.
